"california update 5 / 4 / 01  if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 .  bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack  of support  sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans  and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is  reportedly "" unwilling to fight "" for davis . many legislative republicans and  democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the  bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would "" double dip "" into  the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place .  additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term  power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the  bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of  contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very  difficult .  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would "" eat "" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general  fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8  billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this  concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the  details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward .  currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab  31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill  passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of  republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen ,  currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be  likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) .  according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature ,  republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated  that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued .  other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the  republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally ,  lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan .  key points of the bridge financing  initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b  lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b  lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b  bear stearns $ 625 m  tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt  projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 %  tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 %  current projected  blended ir : 5 . 38 %  maturity date : august 29 , 2001  for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510  bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time  the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the  california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion  authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these  authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the  governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb  6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for  the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this  idea earlier in the crisis .  socal edison and bankruptcy  at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the  first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the  governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is  august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according  to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has  signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis  and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash .  the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond  issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan )  stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers ,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the  state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and  passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for  bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the dwr proportionately from rate payments .",0

"enron net works  it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have  a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad  array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major  catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .  enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we  have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over  $ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .  we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very  specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for  transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the  site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell  at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical  ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,  competitors that can provide this capability .  we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be  dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are  correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .  accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this  opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net  works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a  broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately  be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike  mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial  officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for  enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .  replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron  north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive  committee .  global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net  works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as  an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology  officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the  development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .  enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now  be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to  utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the  following individuals are included in enron net works along with their  current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay  fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,  pulp and paper .  over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational  design and will provide full details on this exciting new business  opportunity .",0
