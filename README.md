# Spam-Detection Engine
Spam Detection Engine using Machine learning algorithms
```
A collection of Jupyter Notebooks that:
    1) naive_bayes_classifier.ipynb - The spam detect engine
    2) install.ipynb - Install all the necessary libraries
```
# ‚ú® Background

I was looking for an application of machine learning in cyber security.  I felt the best field to start was "Spam detection", so this is my start at this project.

# üèÅ Overview

##  ü§ñ naive_bayes_classfier.ipynb - The spam detect engine
Overview: This script will detect spam emails.  Using Naive Bayes algorithms to classify which emails are spam and non-spam.

### To begin

Prerequisites: Python installed and environment established with packages from *install.ipynb* installed.

1) Modify the code to your liking  

2) Run "All Cells" on this install.ipynb to install all the needed libraries

4) Run "All Cells" on .ipynb to start detect spam email from the csv file.
